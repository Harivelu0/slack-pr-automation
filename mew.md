files, each with a specific responsibility:

app.py: The main application file containing:

Flask app initialization and configuration
Route handlers for the API endpoints
The main entry point of the application
The background thread for checking stale PRs


github_handler.py: All GitHub-related functionality:

Webhook signature verification
Functions to process different types of GitHub events (PRs, reviews, comments)
Database interactions related to GitHub data


slack_notifier.py: All Slack-related functionality:

Function to send notifications to Slack
Logic for checking and notifying about stale PRs


db_connection.py

Handles database connection initialization
Creates required database tables if they don't exist
Contains core connection management functionality


db_models.py

Manages CRUD operations for entities (repositories, users, PRs, reviews, comments)
Inherits from the DatabaseConnection class
Implements methods to create, read, update, and manage GitHub data


db_analytics.py

Provides analytics and reporting functionality
Handles stale PR detection and tracking
Generates metrics for dashboards and reports
Also inherits from the DatabaseConnection class


db_handler.py

Acts as the main interface for all database operations
Inherits from both DatabaseModels and DatabaseAnalytics
Provides a unified API for the rest of your application
Includes additional utility methods like connection checking





Root Directory

Contains the main files like README.md and requirements.txt
Has the high-level project files


prequel-app/

Contains the Flask application components
Well separated into app.py, github_handler.py, and slack_notifier.py
This keeps the webhook handling logic cleanly separated from notification logic


prequel-db/

Contains all database-related functionality
Nicely organized into connection, models, analytics, and the main handler
This modular approach will make maintenance much easier


static/ and templates/

Following Flask conventions for web assets and templates
Properly organized CSS and JS files
Template files for the dashboard interface



This structure follows good software engineering practices:

Separation of concerns: Each directory and file has a clear, specific purpose
Modularity: Components are broken down into manageable pieces
Maintainability: Easy to locate specific functionality when changes are needed
Scalability: New features can be added in the appropriate locations without disrupting existing code

The only suggestion I might have is to consider adding a config.py file in the root directory to centralize your configuration settings, but this is a minor point and depends on your specific needs.
Overall, this is an excellent structure that will serve you well as your application grows!
